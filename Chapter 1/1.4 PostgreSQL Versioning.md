#  2.1: PostgreSQL Versioning

## Introduction
PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its extensibility, robustness, and adherence to SQL standards. Understanding PostgreSQL versioning is crucial for database administrators (DBAs) to ensure compatibility, apply updates, and plan upgrades effectively.

This section covers how PostgreSQL versions are structured, the release cycle, support policies, upgrade strategies, and considerations for DBAs managing multiple versions in a production environment.

## PostgreSQL Version Numbering Scheme
PostgreSQL follows a **semantic versioning** scheme starting from version 10. Before version 10, PostgreSQL used a different numbering format.

### 1. Versioning Before PostgreSQL 10
Before PostgreSQL 10, version numbers followed a three-part format:
```plaintext
Major.Minor.Patch
Example: 9.6.3
```
- **Major**: The first number (9) represented a major version.
- **Minor**: The second number (6) indicated minor updates introducing new features.
- **Patch**: The third number (3) represented bug fixes and security patches.

### 2. Versioning from PostgreSQL 10 Onwards
Starting from PostgreSQL 10, the versioning scheme changed to a **two-part format**:
```plaintext
Major.Minor
Example: 10.3
```
- **Major**: The first number (10) represents a major version.
- **Minor**: The second number (3) indicates minor updates that include bug fixes and security patches.
- **No Patch Version**: Security and bug fixes are incorporated into minor releases without changing the major version.

### Example Versions:
| Version | Type | Release Notes |
|---------|------|--------------|
| 9.6.3   | Old (Major.Minor.Patch) | Minor feature updates and patches |
| 10.1    | New (Major.Minor) | Bug fixes and security updates |
| 12.7    | New | Bug fixes and security updates |
| 15.3    | New | Stability and security improvements |

## PostgreSQL Release Cycle and Support Policy
### 1. Major Releases
- PostgreSQL releases a **new major version** once per year, typically in **September**.
- Major versions introduce new features, improvements, and performance optimizations.
- Upgrading between major versions requires **pg_upgrade** or a logical replication strategy.

### 2. Minor Releases
- Minor releases occur every **three months**.
- These releases include **security patches, bug fixes, and minor stability improvements**.
- Minor version upgrades are **in-place updates** and do not require a dump/restore process.

### 3. Long-Term Support (LTS) Policy
- Each major version is supported for **5 years** after its initial release.
- After 5 years, a version reaches **end of life (EOL)** and no longer receives security patches.

### Example PostgreSQL Support Lifecycle:
| Version | Initial Release | End of Life (EOL) |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 11      | September 2018  | November 2023    |
| 12      | September 2019  | November 2024    |
| 13      | September 2020  | November 2025    |
| 14      | September 2021  | November 2026    |
| 15      | September 2022  | November 2027    |

## Checking PostgreSQL Version
DBAs can determine the running PostgreSQL version using various tools.

### 1. Using `psql` (PostgreSQL Command-Line Interface)
```sql
SELECT version();
```
Example Output:
```plaintext
PostgreSQL 15.2 (Ubuntu 22.04) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
```

### 2. Using `postgres --version`
```bash
postgres --version
```
Example Output:
```plaintext
postgres (PostgreSQL) 14.3
```

### 3. Checking via `pgAdmin`
- Open `pgAdmin` and connect to the database.
- Go to the **Dashboard** to see the PostgreSQL version.

## Upgrading PostgreSQL Versions
When upgrading PostgreSQL, DBAs must choose between two methods:

### 1. In-Place Upgrade (Using `pg_upgrade`)
- `pg_upgrade` allows upgrading between major versions with minimal downtime.
- Requires installing the new PostgreSQL version alongside the existing version.

#### Example Steps:
```bash
pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/14/main
pg_upgrade -b /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin -B /usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin -d /var/lib/postgresql/14/main -D /var/lib/postgresql/15/main
pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/15/main
```

### 2. Logical Replication Upgrade
- Uses **logical replication** to migrate data from an old version to a new instance.
- Suitable for **zero-downtime** upgrades.
- Steps include setting up a **logical replication slot** and synchronizing data.

## Best Practices for Managing PostgreSQL Versions
1. **Stay Updated**: Always apply the latest minor updates to receive security patches.
2. **Monitor End of Life (EOL) Dates**: Plan upgrades before support expires.
3. **Test Upgrades in a Staging Environment**: Before upgrading production, test changes in a controlled environment.
4. **Use Backups Before Upgrading**: Always take a full backup before applying a major upgrade.
5. **Review Release Notes**: Before upgrading, read PostgreSQL release notes for breaking changes.
6. **Automate Version Checks**: Use monitoring tools (`pgAdmin`, `Nagios`, `Zabbix`) to track version usage.

## Summary
- PostgreSQL follows a **Major.Minor** versioning scheme since PostgreSQL 10.
- Major versions are released **annually**, and minor versions **quarterly**.
- PostgreSQL versions are supported for **5 years**, and DBAs must track **EOL dates**.
- Upgrades can be performed using **pg_upgrade** or **logical replication**.
- Staying updated with the latest versions ensures security, performance, and feature enhancements.

By understanding PostgreSQL versioning, DBAs can efficiently manage their database infrastructure and ensure smooth upgrades.
