# How Is PostgreSQL Deployed?

PostgreSQL is highly versatile when it comes to deployment. Whether you're running it on your laptop for development, in a secure on-premises data centre, or using a cloud-native managed service, PostgreSQL adapts to a wide range of environments.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è 1. On-Premises Deployment

Many organisations still deploy PostgreSQL **on their own infrastructure**, especially where:

- **Data sovereignty** is a concern  
- **Air-gapped networks** are used (e.g. defence, critical infrastructure)  
- **Performance tuning** and **custom extensions** are needed  
- Regulatory or security requirements demand full control  

**Typical tools/platforms:**

- Linux servers (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian)
- Bare metal or VMs
- Ansible, Puppet, Terraform for automation
- Patroni, Pgpool-II, or repmgr for high availability and replication

> ‚úÖ Maximum control and flexibility  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires in-house PostgreSQL expertise

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 2. Self-Managed in the Cloud

Run PostgreSQL **on cloud infrastructure (IaaS)** such as:

- AWS EC2
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Google Compute Engine

**Advantages:**

- Full control over PostgreSQL version and extensions  
- Choose your own backup and security policies  
- Avoid managed service limitations  

> ‚úÖ Ideal for custom configurations  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è You manage updates, scaling, and HA

## üîß 3. Managed PostgreSQL Cloud Services

Managed services handle the **infrastructure, backups, patching, monitoring, and scaling**, allowing teams to focus on development.

### Major Providers and Services

| Service                             | Provider         | Notes                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**       | AWS              | Simplified setup with Multi-AZ HA options               |
| **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL**        | AWS              | Proprietary fork optimised for performance              |
| **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**   | Microsoft Azure  | Flexible Server and Single Server deployment models     |
| **Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL** | Google Cloud     | Integrated IAM and automated failover                   |
| **Crunchy Bridge**                  | Crunchy Data     | Enterprise PostgreSQL with strong security/HA support   |
| **Aiven for PostgreSQL**            | Aiven.io         | Multi-cloud, observability, and Kafka integration       |
| **Supabase**                        | Supabase         | Developer-friendly BaaS built entirely on PostgreSQL    |
| **Timescale**                       | Timescale        | Hosted PostgreSQL with time-series optimisation         |

> ‚úÖ Great for startups and SaaS products  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited flexibility and potential cloud lock-in

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 4. Kubernetes-Native PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL can also be deployed as part of **Kubernetes clusters** for cloud-native, DevOps-driven teams.

### Popular Kubernetes Operators

- **Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes**
- **StackGres**
- **Zalando Postgres Operator**
- **CloudNativePG** (by EDB)

**Features:**

- Declarative PostgreSQL resources
- Automated failover, backups, patching
- CI/CD and GitOps-friendly

> ‚úÖ Ideal for microservices and multi-cloud workloads  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Steeper learning curve, requires Kubernetes expertise

## Summary: PostgreSQL Deployment Models

| Deployment Model         | Best For                                         | Notes                                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| On-Premises              | Enterprises needing control and security         | Highly customisable, requires expertise        |
| Self-Managed in Cloud    | Flexible cloud use without vendor lock-in        | More setup, but cost-effective and powerful    |
| Managed Cloud Services   | Startups, SaaS, and lean teams                   | Easy to scale, lower overhead                  |
| Kubernetes-Native        | DevOps-first and microservice architectures      | Portable, scalable, automation-friendly        |
